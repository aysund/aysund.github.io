ðŸ§  Scientist, Experimental Psychologist | ðŸš€ AR/VR Explorer | ðŸ“Š Data Science


Hi there! I am Aysun, a scientist with a passion for human perception and cognition. I thrive on the challenge of understanding how our senses interact with the world around us, and how to augment human capabilities with new technologies.

My research is focused at the intersection of science and technology, where I aim to advance our understanding of human mind and use this knowledge to drive innovations. My goal is to contribute to groundbreaking technological developments that can enhance our daily lives.

With a deep love for mathematics, probability, and statistics, I find beauty in the patterns that underlie the world and human behavior. My proficiency in these areas equips me with the tools to unlock insights to human mind and push the boundaries of what's possible.

I completed my PhD student in the [Carrasco Lab][CarrascoLabLink], Cognition & Perception Program of New York University. In my dissertation, I explored how our visual perception is influenced by the  interplay between attention and expectation. I dive headfirst into the vast sea of human behavior and eye-tracking data, employing the principles of psychophysics to uncover the secrets of human vision and mind.

During my journey, I did two internships at [Meta Reality Labs Research][RLRLink], where I had the opportunity to work on Augmented and Virtual Reality. These experiences not only deepened my fascination with human interaction in virtual environments but also provided me with hands-on expertise in this exciting field.

I am always open for nerdy, scientific discussions. Follow me on [Twitter][TwitterLink], add me on [LinkedIn][LinkedInLink], or shoot me an [email][emailLink]!
